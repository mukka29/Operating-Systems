# Operating-Systems
CMPSCI:4760 Operating Systems Projects
# Course Description
This course covers the structure of a generic operating system, considering in detail the al- gorithms for interprocess communications, process scheduling, resource management, memory management, file systems, and device management. It presents examples from contemporary operating systems. This course also requires practical projects implemented within a modern operating system or simulator environment.
# Topics
Weâ€™ll discuss the structure of a generic operating system, with an emphasis on the algorithms and data structures needed to perform various tasks to manage processes, resources, memory, files, and IO devices. There will be extensive programming in C under Linux environment. The sequence of topics will be as follows:
*Function, Types, and Structure of Operating Systems
*Concurrent Programming, Process Interaction and Synchronization
*Process Management and Scheduling
* Resource Management and Deadlock Problem
*Memory Management
*File System and I/O management
